This section contains rules for characters wishing to create items of all types.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Determine Item</h2>\n<p>First, the character must choose the item they wish to create. Some items cannot be created, such as those that only occur naturally, so the GM should use discretion when determining if a character can craft an item. The character must also choose the quality of the item, if applicable, which when combined with the item’s base price will allow them to determine the approximate market value of the item.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Gather Raw Materials</h2>\n<p>Next the character must gather the raw materials necessary to create the item. Exactly what this entails will vary from item to item, but <strong>as a general rule of thumb if the character wishes to purchase all the raw materials it will cost roughly one third of the item’s price as calculated in the last step.</strong></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Determine Test Difficulty</h2>\n<p>Third the character determines the difficulty of the crafting test. The difficulty of the crafting test for most items is based solely on the quality of the item, and modified further as the GM sees fit. When creating weapons or armor the material also provides a modifier.

masters of craftsmanship, and it is possible for mortals to utilize many of their secret ritual techniques to create Daedric armor and weapony, which draw power from a Daedric soul consumed during the creation of the item itself. However, detailed knowledge of the specifics of this process can be hard to come across. While this book contains prices and AR values for Daedric weapons and armor, expanded rules for creating and using these powerful items can be found in <strong>the Scroll of Oblivion</strong> supplement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Step 4: Make Crafting Test</h2>\n<p>Next the character makes the actual crafting test using the difficulty determined in the previous step. The skill that the character tests is based on the item they wish to craft. Creating weapons or armor uses the <strong>Profession [Smithing]</strong> skill, while other items will usually use some other variation of the <strong>Profession [Field]</strong> skill as appropriate. Failure produces no item, while critical success halves the time required.</p>\n<p>Creating any item requires the appropriate craft tools. In the case of smithing, the character will also need access to a forge (along with the related facilities and tools) in order to complete the product. The actual act of crafting can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (and sometimes even longer). During this time the character must be focused on creating the item. The duration required is left to the GM, and should be based on the complexity of the item in question.</p>\n<h2>Runed Weapons/Armor</h2>\n<p>Characters with knowledge of Enchanting can imbue weapons and armor with magic runes that make them effective against certain types of enemies. The character must pass an Enchant test when creating the item (there is no penalty for failure). On success add the Magic weapon/armor quality</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Repairing Weapons &amp; Armor</strong></p>\n<p>Much like people, gear does not always survive combat. In the event that a weapon or piece of armor is damaged, a character can attempt to repair it with a Profession [Smithing] skill test. This takes about an hour and requires raw materials worth five percent of the price of the item. Given a successful skill test, the character can reduce the X value of the Damaged (X) weapon/armor quality on the damaged item by their degrees of success</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.HVWNtVKipPaYQDTi"}},"_id":"32O9Pndwu8do4zTk"}

{"name":"Types of Tests","content":"<h1>Types of Tests</h1>\n<p>You won’t always be testing your character in the same way every session. There are four different types of tests that a character can be called to make, each reflecting a different circumstance.</p>\n<h2>Standard Tests</h2>\n<p>Tests without any opposition are known as Standard Tests. They measure how well a character performs an action in a particular situation. Standard tests are handled as described on the previous page: a result less than or equal to the modified target number is a success, and a result above the target number is a failure. The GM can call for the character to calculate their degrees of success on the roll if it is required by the test, or if they just want to have that additional metric.</p>\n<p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p>\n<p>Two or more characters can work together on a single task. The character leading the effort is the one who makes the actual test, and as long as having someone to assist them would be productive then they may re-roll the test once if they fail initially. The helper(s) do not need to be trained in the skill being used as long as the GM decides that they can follow directions, or make themselves useful in some other way.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Test</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes the GM may call for multiple characters to attempt to accomplish a task where each member of the group is expected to perform. In these cases the characters who are more skilled can help cover for their comrades. To make a group test, everyone in the group rolls the same test with the same modifiers. If at least half of the group succeeds, then the whole group does. Otherwise the group fails. This can be used to represent things like a group of characters attempting to navigate dangerous terrain, or avoid detection by enemies.</p>\n<h2>Simple Tests</h2>\n<p>In many circumstances there is no chance that a character will fail a particular action, but the GM wants a simple gauge of how well the character performs. In this case, a <strong>Simple Test </strong>may be employed. This is handled just like a standard test, but rather than determining success or failure, the result of the test determines whether the character succeeds strongly (passes the test) or succeeds weakly (fails the test).</p>\n<h2>Opposed Tests</h2>\n<p>Whenever a character’s action is directly opposed by that of another character, the GM can call for an <strong>Opposed Test</strong>. Both characters make a test against each other, with the result determining the winner. To make an opposed test, each character rolls a standard test as appropriate to the situation. If only one of the characters succeeds, that character wins. If both succeed, then the characters have tied. If both fail, then nobody wins. Note that both characters do not have to actually roll the same test: characters making different tests for different actions can still be acting in opposition to one another.</p>\n<p>Opposed tests that result in a tie (both characters succeed) are typically broken by comparing degrees of success, with the character who has the greater success being the winner. Further ties can be broken by having the characters reroll. But sometimes the GM may rule that the test has simply resulted in a tie and the two characters remain locked against each other until one of them gives up or another opposed test is made.</p>\n<p>If a character rolls a critical success during an opposed test, they automatically win the contest regardless of their opponent’s degrees of success (unless both rolled a critical success, in which case the tie is broken by a roll off).</p>\n<h2>Extended Tests</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the GM may rule that a single task may require more than one test to achieve. An extended test is simply a series of one or more tests made by a character where each successful test adds to the character’s total degrees of success. Once their total reaches a threshold decided by the GM, they pass the test. This can be used to simulate tasks like breaking down a door.</p>\n<p>Most extended tests are also performed under some sort of time pressure. With infinite time it is assumed the character could eventually complete the task. But if the task has a time limit then “failure” is simply represented by not achieving success in the allotted time.</p>\n<p><em>Example: An Imperial soldier is attempting to bash down a door to help their comrade on the other side, who is beset by foes. The GM rules that this requires an extended test, and that each turn the soldier can make a Strength test to attempt to damage the door. The GM has decided that 10 degrees of success are necessary to overcome the door. On their first turn the soldier succeeds with 5 degrees. On their second, they fail. On their first turn of the second round they succeed with 3 degrees. And on their second turn of the second round, they succeed with 4 degrees and finally smashes the door down. Fortunately their ally is still alive, and at the start of the third round the soldier draws their sword and rushes into the room...</em></p>\n<h2>Characteristic &amp; Skill Tests</h2>\n<p>Until now, we have simplified the concept of tests. Characters are largely defined by their characteristics, which provide the base target number for almost all tests. Characters also have skills, which can affect tests different tests in certain circumstances. All tests (regardless of the test’s type) can be divided into two categories based on whether a characteristic or a skill is used to determine the target number.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristic Tests </strong>are tests made with a target number based on one of a character’s characteristic scores and modified as appropriate for the difficulty of the test. These tests are used when a character is performing a task that does not require or benefit from specialized training and relies only on their natural abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Tests are</strong> tests made with a target number based on one of a character’s characteristic scores and their relevant skill level. Like characteristic tests, skill tests are also modified as appropriate for the difficulty of the test; unlike characteristic tests, skill tests also take into account a character’s skill at whatever task they are attempting. Skill tests are used when a task requires some form of specialized training or skill to perform well.</p>\n<p>Each skill has an associated set of governing characteristics (listed in parenthesis next to the skill, typically) which are the characteristics upon which that skill relies. Typically the player chooses which characteristic to use, but the GM may require that they must use a particular one if they feel the circumstances dictate it.</p>\n<p>Once the governing characteristic has been determined, add the character’s skill bonus (equal to ten times their skill rank) and any other applicable modifiers to the characteristic score. This value is the target number for the skill test.</p>\n<p><em>Example: A thief attempts to leap delicately between two rooftops. The GM rules this requires an Acrobatics test of Challenging difficulty (-10). The thief has the Acrobatics (Str, Ag) skill trained to the Journeyman rank (+20). The player chooses Agility as the base characteristic for the test as it is higher than her Strength and better fits the task at hand. She applies a net +10 modifier to her Agility score of 43. She then rolls a 37, which is a success (with 3 degrees) against her target number of 53.</em></p>\n<h2>Limited Skill Tests</h2>\n<p>In some circumstances the GM may rule that a character’s skill in one area is limited by their lack of skill in another. For example, a character fighting while balancing on a moving surface is limited by their ability to balance themself properly. In these cases the character may not take advantage of any of their ranks in the primary skill that would exceed their ranks in the limiting one.</p>\n<p><em>Example: A smuggler is dueling with a pirate on the deck of a ship on the high seas. The ship is rocking heavily in the waves, and unfortunately for the smuggler they are not able to balance themself well enough to fight to their full potential in this environment. Their Combat Style skill, normally rank 3 (+30), is treated as being rank 1 (+10) because that is their Acrobatics skill rank. </em></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.XK2IdnpfsaLfJtaR"}},"_id":"5flocawaluoJdlRh"}

A <strong>Form </strong>is the “shape” of the spell. Some spells are cast across wide areas (like a fireball, which uses the “ball” form) while others are cast only on the caster themself (the “self” form).</li>\n<li>Creating a spell is a matter of combining effects and forms that are allowed to fit together, setting the parameters of each, and then writing down the combined result so that you can reference it during gameplay.<strong><br /></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Multi Part Spells</strong><br />Unconventional spells can also be multi-part spells, which simply means that they contain multiple spells in a single spell. For example a character might create a spell that when cast allows him to both jump further and walk on water, which are two separate effects. These distinct parts are referred to as <strong>Spell Parts</strong>, while the spell containing them is referred to as the <strong>Parent Spell</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong><br />A character can use any form when creating an unconventional spell, but may only utilize effects from schools of magic in which they are trained (meaning the skill is novice rank or higher).</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Attributes</strong><br />Spell attributes are “tags” that modify the rules of a spell, or clarify how they function in game terms. Effects and forms each have spell attributes associated with them that are combined when the complete spell profile is created.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials</strong><br />A complete list of effects, forms, and spell attributes can be found in the Spell Making Reference in the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create Spell Parts</h2>\n<p>First pick the combination(s) of effects and forms that will make up the various part(s) of the spell.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine Spell Parameters</h2>\n<p>Next, decide on the parameters of each effect/form. Each effect and form have associated parameters (spell level and magnitude) that determine the strength of the effect, and the size of the form, respectively.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 3:</strong> Determine Spell Cost</h2>\n<p>Once the spell parameters are decided, simply “plug in” your chosen values into the effect cost and form cost formulas provided for your chosen effect(s) and form(s). The total cost of all these values added together for each spell part is the total magicka cost of the spell.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 4:</strong> Determine Spell Level &amp; School</h2>\n<p>The spell level of an unconventional spell is equal to the highest spell level used in one of that spell’s parts. If the parent spell has multiple parts, increase this level by one for each part beyond the first. The school of a spell is the school of its highest level spell part.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create Spell</h2>\n<p>To create a spell a character must pass an extended skill test using that spell’s school. The success threshold for the creation test is three times the spell’s level, and each test the character makes represents a day of experimentation and study. For each test the character makes they must also consume experimental materials worth approximately 25 drakes. This represents the unpredictable nature of magical experimentation, and the fact that creating a spell requires both time and resources.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 6:</strong> Finalize Spell</h2>\n<p>Write down the details of the new spell somewhere you can reference it, including its cost, level, attributes, and various parts.

The purpose of the ritual is to amplify the power of the source of magicka chosen. Because characters are harnessing so much energy, there is always a potential for danger if the character errs in the ritual.</p>\n<p>Rituals require specific steps and have unique magical effects. They represent more obscure forms of magic, often known only to a few. Each one must be learned independently and has its own steps that must be taken, costs that must be paid, and penalties for failure.</p>\n<p>Because rituals represent obscure, specialized forms of magic, the GM should not allow just any character to learn them. <strong>Learning a ritual costs twenty five XP, and the character must have some means of learning the ritual (such as a book or a teacher).</strong> Not every character should be allowed to learn every ritual (GM’s discretion). Below are a few of the many such rituals that exist. Others can be found in other books, and as usual players and GMs are encouraged to create their own.</p>\n<h2>Ritual Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Ritual spellcasting is a means of utilizing rituals to power a spell. A character can perform a ritual in order to utilize alternative magicka sources to power a particularly costly spell.</p>\n<h3><strong>Magicka Source and Ritual Focus</strong></h3>\n<p>The character must choose a source of magicka to fuel the spell. Characters may use their own magicka reserves, a unit of alchemical ingredients, a filled soul gem, or any combination of any number of the above. If multiple characters are cooperating to perform a ritual, they can combine their magicka pools for the purposes of paying the magicka cost of the spell.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each ritual requires a ritual focus. This is an item, which can differ from ritual to ritual, that focuses and amplifies the magic forces involved in the ritual. The nature of this item is left to the GM (though they should feel free to pass this decision off to the player performing the ritual), but it should be in some way thematically related to the ritual being performed.</p>\n<p>This can be anything from a human heart to an ornate tattoo created on the body of the character performing the ritual. The only limit is the imagination of the GM and the players.</p>\n<h3><strong>Resolve Ritual</strong></h3>\n<p>The magicka cost must be paid from the chosen magicka source. If the character is using their own magicka reserves, simply deduct the cost as you would for a spell. If the character is using a soul gem, deduct the cost from its soul energy and destroy the gem. If the character is using alchemical ingredients, deduct the cost from the ingredient pool) and destroy the ingredients.</p>\n<p>If the cost would reduce the magicka in the magicka source to below zero, then the casting fails automatically. If the character passed their casting test, the spell is resolved as it normally would.</p>\n<p>If the character failed their casting test, the spell is not cast and the ritual has backfired. Roll on the backfire table corresponding to the school of the spell and add one to the resulting roll for each degree of failure.

For the purpose of a caster’s effective spell level (see page 81), add +1 to the governing school’s skill rank (see page 14). This test suffers a -10 penalty for each point by which the spell level exceeds the character’s effective rank in that skill.

They suffer an additional -20 penalty to the test if they do not have two free hands, either because they are holding items or because their movement is restricted in some way.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Resolve the Spell</h2>\n<p>Pass or fail, the caster reduces their magicka by the listed cost of the spell. If this would reduce the character’s magicka to below zero, then the spell is not successfully cast.</p>\n<p>If the caster passed the test, resolve the effects of the spell as written. If the character is casting a multi-part spell then resolve each part of the spell simultaneously (meaning that none of the parts benefit from the effects of any of the other parts).

Instead of being paid from the user’s magicka pool the cost of the spell is drawn from the item’s soul energy pool. Upkeep spells can be maintained by paying 2 * the spell’s level from the soul energy pool.</p>\n<p><strong>The user counts as having passed the casting test with a number of degrees of success equal to the binding strength of the enchantment.</strong> A cast enchantment’s Binding Strength represents how well the enchantment was woven: stronger enchantments are more responsive to their users, and enable them to more easily shape the spell to their will.</p>\n<h3><strong>Soul Energy Pool &amp; Recharging</strong></h3>\n<p>Cast enchantments do not last forever! Each cast with the item reduces the item’s <strong>Soul Energy Pool</strong> by 1. If this would reduce the size of the pool to below zero, then the enchantment can no longer be cast and must be recharged.</p>\n<p>Recharging an item requires that the character be trained in the Enchant skill (though no test is required), and that they have a soul gem with energy stored within it. A simple minute long ritual is required: on completion the ES * 2 of the soul gem is added to the pool. Any energy that would exceed the pool’s maximum size is lost and the gem is destroyed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multi Spell Enchantments</strong></h3>\n<p>Characters can create cast enchantments that have more than one spell stored (to a maximum of 3) but these enchantments are more difficult to create, and characters require a talent to attempt it. When used these function like normal cast enchantments, but the user simply chooses which spell to cast and reduces the amount of spells stored in the item from the it’s soul energy pool.</p>\n<h3><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong></h3>\n<p>A character does not need to know a particular spell in order to imbue an item with it. Enchanters can also use any combination of effects and forms availible during the spell making process, and they do not need to be trained in a particular school to use effects from that school. Note that using a spell with a level above the character’s Enchant skill rank may be more difficult!</p>\n<h3><strong>Reference Materials</strong></h3>\n<p>A list of effects and forms can be found in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>Follow these steps to imbue items with cast enchantments:</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Choose Item</h2>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Cast enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Items without a listed Enchantment Level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</h2>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have a ES less than or equal to the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Choose Enchantment Spell(s)</h2>\n<p>Cast enchantments can be used to store either conventional or unconventional spells. In the case of conventional spells, simply pick from the list in this chapter. Unconventional spells will need to be built using the effects and forms provided in the appendix as normal (though the enchanter does not actually need to spend the time or money to create the spell, and no test is needed).</p>\n<p>Once the enchanter has chosen the spell they will use for the cast enchantment, note its spell level for the next step. <strong>The Spell level used for the enchantment must be less than or equal to the ES of the soul gem used.</strong> If the enchanter is imbuing multiple spells into the cast enchantment, note the details for each one.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes.</p>\n<p>The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the chosen spell level exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable). Test again for any additional spells being added, if necessary. Failing a test means that spell is not successfully enchanted.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Write down the following details somewhere you can reference them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spells</strong>: Add the details of any spells included in the cast enchantment, including their spell level and effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Binding Strength</strong>: The binding strength (min 1) of the enchantment is equal to the DoS achieved on the enchant skill test.</li>\n<li><strong>Soul Energy Pool Max</strong>: The item’s soul energy pool max is equal to the Enchanter’s enchant skill rank * 2 .</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.s8z0AAlujDP3zAAW"}}}

{"_id":"RidVxZB0PbwBkod6","name":"Combat","content":"<h1>Combat</h1>\n<p>The largest unit of structured time is called an encounter. An <strong>Encounter </strong>represents an entire sequence of dramatic events that make up a unified “block” of structured time that may be contained within sections of narrative time, or followed up by another encounter. Encounters focused on a particular combat scene are known as Combat Encounters.</p>\n<p>Encounters are broken down into <strong>Rounds</strong>: periods of time in which characters take actions, representing roughly six seconds of “real” time. During a round the GM counts down from highest to lowest initiative, giving each character a turn to act when their initiative step is reached, until every character has had a turn. During a Turn, the active character spends at least 1 AP to perform an action and resolves its effects. </p>\n<h3><strong>Effect Durations</strong></h3>\n<p>Effect durations are measured in rounds, and end immediately after the initiative step on which they took effect. For example, if an Orc is stunned for 2 rounds on their turn, they remain stunned until right after the end of their turn 2 rounds later (assuming their turn takes place at the same initiative “step” as it did originally).</p>\n<h2>Combat Overview</h2>\n<p>Combat encounters can be resolved by following these steps:</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Determine Surprise</strong></h3>\n<p>If one or more characters aren’t expecting an attack, or aware of their attacker’s intentions, they have been surprised. The GM should determine which characters count as being surprised for the first round of combat. Surprised characters do not roll 1d6 for initiative, they simply use their Initiative Rating. They also may only take reactions after their first turn has passed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Set the Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>Before the characters can begin taking their turns, the GM should outline the parts of the scenario that they are aware of, including the combatants they face, the positions of everyone involved, and the environment they’re fighting in. If the group is using a battle map or grid, this would be the time to set it up!</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Determine Initiative</strong></h3>\n<p>To determine the order in which characters take their turns during each round of the combat, all characters involved must make an <strong>Initiative Roll</strong> (1d6 plus the character’s Initiative Rating, using the characters Initiative Rating and then Luck bonus (meaning PCs beat NPCs) to break ties, in that order). The GM rolls initiative for any NPCs involved, and should roll once for larger groups of similar NPCs. If new combatants enter the picture, simply have them roll and take their place in the order as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters that aren’t surprised and that haven’t started their turn yet may still take up to three reactions excluding Attacks of Opportunity and Counter Attacking.</strong> For each reaction taken in this way, the character starts with one less AP when their turn starts for this round</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Round Start</strong></h3>\n<p>Starting with the character with the highest initiative, each character takes one turn. <strong>During each Turn, the active character gains 3 AP, and spends at least 1 AP to perform a combat action and resolves its effects. If they have no AP left to spend, they do not get a turn this round.</strong> Even if the character does nothing, they still lose the AP. The character currently taking a turn is known as the active character. Once their turn is over, the character with the next highest initiative takes their turn, and so on until all characters have taken a turn. Sometimes the rules will refer to initiative “steps,” which simply refer to individual initiative values in the order.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Round End</strong></h3>\n<p>Once all characters have had a turn, the round is over. Any effects or Conditions that specify a duration of “until the end of the round” end now.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Encounter</strong></h3>\n<p>Ends Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the combat is finished, or the event that triggered the switch into structured time is resolved.</p>\n<h2>Mapping Combat</h2>\n<p>This chapter assumes players are using some sort of grid or battle map to track the positions of characters. For ease of use, each grid square in such a system should represent a square meter. More details on using a combat grid, or advice for playing the game without one, can be found later in this chapter.</p>\n<h2>Action Types</h2>\n<p>Actions represent all the things that a character can do during an encounter. The maximum number of times that a character can act during a round is determined by their max AP. Characters should take at least one action on their turn, but if they don’t take an action they still use up an AP for that turn. <strong>All non-free actions cost at least 1 AP unless otherwise stated.</strong></p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.Gvt0uM4V4rSJY2sG]{Primary Actions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.r1sV6Vz7CTnkPRV2]{Secondary Actions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.hI5vr58cKUahhA7I]{Reactions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.Entkbavwwtt6S5M6]{Special Actions}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.AQNPTwPcThuHh0eg]{Free Actions}</p>\n<h3><strong>Multiple Action Turns</strong></h3>\n<p>Because characters can take multiple primary or secondary actions on their turn, it is possible that characters can use up all of their AP to create some interesting action combinations when their turn arises. <strong>When declaring multiple actions on their turn, the character must declare them individually, resolving other character’s reactions first before declaring and resolving any more.</strong></p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.cEk045rHbX3vNTey]{Attacking and Defending}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.xzYDXTCA1iB0LbCq]{Advantages}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.5OJPpPByh7NEquIp]{Critical Success and Failure}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.hn9uMMYBjERw5M7Q]{Melee Combat}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.fRtDFowRTRAVBca0]{Ranged Combat}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[uesrpg-third-edition.core-rulebook-v3.SkV7rnjz29YGmV0b]{Mounted Combat}</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.L3yM9Foe3VphQJDh"}}}

Once a character has used all of their LP for a given session, they can resort to burning luck (see below).</li>\n<li>Characters may spend a Luck point in order to modify the narrative in some way, such as retroactively “remembering” to purchase something that would be helpful for the party.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Luck Tests</h2>\n<p>In certain situations the GM can call upon the character to make a Luck test in scenarios when they need to determine whether or not some random event happens to work in the character’s favor. For example, if a character is knocking on doors during the night trying to find someone to help them, the GM could have the character make a Luck roll to determine if someone happens to be at awake to hear them. These tests function just like any other characteristic test.</p>\n<h2>Burning Luck</h2>\n<p>The player characters are the heroes of the story, and fortune favors heroes! Characters may choose to permanently reduce their Luck characteristic score by one or more points in order to benefit from a number of different effects. This is known as <strong>Burning Luck.</strong></p>\n<p>Luck that a character burns never regenerates naturally. A character may burn any amount of Luck at any time.</p>\n<p>Characters may burn Luck for the following effects. If they do not have the required amount, simply burn all remaining Luck:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn 1 Luck: </strong>Add a degree of success to a successful test. This can be done multiple times for a given test.</li>\n<li><strong>Burn 3 Luck: </strong>Re-roll a failed test. This may only be done once for a given test.</li>\n<li><strong>Burn 5 Luck:</strong> Negate the effects of a critical failure. This must be done immediately after the test is rolled.</li>\n<li><strong>Burn 10 Luck:</strong> Ignore the effects of a wound (though they still take the damage). Alternatively, and with GM permission, this can be used to allow a character to survive death at great cost (they are removed from play until the end of the encounter instead). Some GMs may not want players to have the ability to extend the life of a character this way, depending on the tone of a campaign.</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.h5qrmB0fKYywyiXD"}}}

{"_id":"j5elEXljoAUJUxuG","name":"Constant Enchantments","content":"<h1>Constant Enchantments</h1>\n<p>This section contains rules for creating and using constant enchantments.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Basics</strong></h3>\n<p>Constant enchantments are passive enchantments that can be applied to any sort of item, and that constantly affect the wearer or wielder of that item. <strong>In game terms, constant enchantments apply their effects to the character wearing/wielding them at the start of each round (regardless of their normal duration)</strong>. If the effect is dispelled, it returns to full functionality after 1d4 rounds. Constant enchantments do not need to be recharged like cast enchantments and have no soul energy pool. The wearer or wielder of a constant enchantment can willingly disable or re-enable its effects at any time using the Cast Magic secondary action.</p>\n<h3><strong>Learning Effects &amp; Forms</strong></h3>\n<p>A character may attempt to create a constant enchantment using any effect from any school as long as that effect has the Upkeep Attribute, and a listed duration. It is not dependent on their knowledge of any spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multi Effect Enchantments</strong></h3>\n<p>Characters can create constant enchantments that have more than one effect (to a maximum of 3) but these enchantments are more difficult to create, and characters require a talent to attempt it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reference Materials</strong></h3>\n<p>The complete list of effects can be found on the page below.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Choose Item</h2>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Constant enchantments can be applied to any item, but only some items will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Items without a listed enchantment level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</h2>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have an ES equal to or greater than the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Choose Constant Effect(s)</h2>\n<p>Constant enchantments are not created using the normal spell making rules. Instead, the enchanter simply picks the effect(s) they want and compares the combined enchantment strength(s) of their chosen effects to the table on the page below.</p>\n<p>Every effect has an EL min, this is the minimum enchantment level an item must have in order to use that effect. The enchantment strength chosen for the effect must be less than or equal to the enchantment strength of the soul gem used. Add the enchantment strength of any enchantments used when calculating multiple enchantments.</p>\n<p>If the soul gem has enough enchantment strength to power the enchantment, then they can attempt to create it, otherwise it is impossible as the enchantment cannot sustain itself on so little energy.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes. The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the total enchantment strength of the chosen effect(s) exceeds their enchant skill rank (if applicable).</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Be sure to write down the effect(s) of the enchantment for reference.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:490px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Effect (EL = Enchantment Strength)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:13.1507%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>EL min</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;height:34px\">Elemental Armour<br />[Fire, Frost, Shock, Poison]</td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;height:34px\">Affected target gains ES AR of the chosen [type]</td>\n<td style=\"width:13.1507%;text-align:center;height:34px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;height:17px\">Magic Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;height:17px\">Affected target gains (ES-3) magic AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:13.1507%;text-align:center;height:17px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;height:17px\">Armour</td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;height:17px\">Affected target gains (ES-1) AR</td>\n<td style=\"width:13.1507%;text-align:center;height:17px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;height:17px\">Feather</td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;height:17px\">Affected target lowers its Encumbrance level by one, and treats its armor as being one weight class lighter (target counts as being trained to wear this type of armor even if they normally would not be).</td>\n<td style=\"width:13.1507%;text-align:center;height:17px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:27.4608%;height:17px\">Physical Shield*</td>\n<td style=\"width:58.7199%;height:17px\">Affected target gains (ES-1) temporary bonus HP against physical damage.

{"_id":"jkbhZzXadJzzseHK","name":"Creating Potions","content":"<h1>Creating Potions</h1>\n<p>This section contains the rules for creating potions.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Unlike spells, potions do not have forms. Creating a potion is simply a matter of choosing the desired effects, setting the parameters of that effect to determine a final cost, and then writing down the effects of the potion for reference.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi Effect Potions:</strong> Characters can create potions that impart multiple effects when consumed. Creating these sorts of potions can prove more difficult for the character, but is not much more complicated than creating a normal potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Effects: </strong>A character can use any effect from any school when creating potions, but attempting to use effects of a higher level than the character’s rank in the Alchemy skill can be difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference Materials:</strong> A complete list of effects can be found in the Appendix.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Choose Ingredients</h2>\n<p>First, decide on which ingredients you will use for the potion. Each ingredient included allows for a single effect to be added to the potion, and no more than three ingredients (and thus three effects, <strong>which must be unique</strong>) can be used in a single potion.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Pick Effects &amp; Determine Parameters</h2>\n<p>Next, pick the effect(s) (maximum 3) that the potion will produce, and decide on their parameters. Only effects with the potion attribute may be used.</p>\n<p>The school(s) from which effects are chosen are limited to the school and number of ingredients used in the potion (for example, one destruction and one alteration ingredient would allow for one destruction and one alteration effect). Each effect has an associated value, called spell level, that determines its strength. The chosen spell level may not be higher than the depth of the chosen ingredient.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Determine Spell Cost</h2>\n<p>Next, simply “plug in” your chosen spell level values to the effect cost formula provided for your chosen effect(s). If the cost of an effect is higher than the strength of the corresponding ingredient, then you must reduce the spell level of that effect.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create Potion</h2>\n<p>To create a potion a character must pass an Alchemy skill test. <strong>This test suffers a -10 penalty for each level by which the potion’s highest spell level effect exceeds the Alchemy skill rank of the character, and an additional -10 for potions with more than one effect.</strong> Creating a potion takes a number of hours equal to the total of the spell levels of its effects, and requires a set of alchemical tools. Ingredients are lost on failure.</p>\n<p>If a character critically fails this test, or fails normally when creating a potion that either includes multiple effects or an effect with a level above their Alchemy skill rank, the potion backfires.

Characters will be called to make tests in a variety of scenarios, but it’s important to remember that tests are not required for every action. There’s no need to make a test to have your character take a few steps across a room. If, on the other hand, you find your character forced to walk across a tightrope suspended above a lake of molten lava in order to escape angry Dremora (or something equally dramatic), then you will probably want to know if your character manages to cross in time. It is recommended that the GM only require tests if one or more of the following conditions hold true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The activity is unusual for the character, and not something they attempt routinely.</li>\n<li>The character is lacking the time and/or tools necessary to complete the task.</li>\n<li>The circumstances and environment impose stress.</li>\n<li>There are meaningful consequences for failing the action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You make tests by making a percentile roll and comparing the result to a <strong>Target Number(TN)</strong>, typically a value between 1 and 99. <strong>If the roll is less than or equal to the target number, the character succeeds. If the roll is higher than the target number, they fail.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Example: A character is attempting a very difficult task at which they are relatively skilled. After accounting for modifiers (more on these later), they determine that their target number for the test is 37. They manage to roll a 32, below their target number, so they succeed!</em></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LXwsNx7AW6G7nT1R"}}}

{"_id":"q0JDmU2qA34CH1jk","name":"Strike Enchantments","content":"<h1>Strike Enchantments</h1>\n<p>This section contains rules for creating/using strike enchantments.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Basics</strong></h3>\n<p>Strike enchantments are augmentations applied to weapons that grant some sort of offensive effect when the weapon is used in combat. <strong>The effects of strike enchantments are applied on any successful hit with the weapon.</strong> Strike enchantments do not need to be recharged like cast enchantments and have no soul energy pool. Ammo enchanted this way only works once.</p>\n<h3><strong>Learning Effects</strong></h3>\n<p>Strike enchantments use a unique set of effects drawn from the table below.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Choose Item</h2>\n<p>First the enchanter must pick an item to enchant. Strike enchantments can be applied to any ranged or melee weapon, but only some weapons will have an enchantment level high enough to reasonably support more powerful enchantments. Ammunition can be enchanted in “batches” of 25 shots (use the EL of one shot). Items without a listed enchantment level have an EL of 0.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose Soul Gem</h2>\n<p>Next the enchanter must pick the soul gem they will use for the enchantment. This gem must have an ES equal to or greater than the EL of the item. Once a soul gem has been used to create an enchantment it is destroyed and any excess energy is lost.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Choose Enchantment Effect</h2>\n<p>Strike enchantments use a unique set of effects drawn from the table below: choose the desired effect (at most one, though some talents allow for more) and ES. Every effect has an EL min, this is the minimum EL an item must have in order to use that effect. The ES chosen for the effect must be less than or equal to the ES of the soul gem used. Add the ES of any enchantments used when calculating multiple enchantments.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create the Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Now the enchanter can attempt to create the enchantment. This requires a ritual that lasts approximately eight hours, and consumes materials worth approximately 100 drakes.</p>\n<p>The enchanter then makes an enchant skill test with a -10 penalty for each level by which the total ES of all chosen effects exceed their enchant skill rank (if applicable). Failing the test means that effect is not successfully enchanted.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Finalize Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the tests, the soul gem is destroyed and its energy is lost. If the enchanter passes a test then they successfully create the enchanted item. Write down the details somewhere you can reference them later.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Optional Rule - Strike Enchantment Charges</strong></p>\n<p>If you want strike enchantments to function like cast enchantments, use the Soul Energy Pool &amp; Recharging rules on the last page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:302px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.4492%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:55.1072%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Effect (ES = Enchantment Strength)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:17.775%;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>EL min</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.4492%;height:17px\">[Fire, Frost, Shock, Poison]</td>\n<td style=\"width:55.1072%;height:17px\">Weapon deals ES additional [type] damage.</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.775%;text-align:center;height:17px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.4492%;height:17px\">Fatigue</td>\n<td style=\"width:55.1072%;height:17px\">Weapon causes the target to test Endurance with a (30-[10 x ES]) modifier or lose 1 SP</td>\n<td style=\"width:17.775%;text-align:center;height:17px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:26.4492%;height:17px\">Sunlight</td>\n<td style=\"width:55.1072%;height:17px\">Weapon deals ES additional fire damage.

{"name":"Difficulty and Modifiers","content":"<h2>Difficulty &amp; Modifiers</h2>\n<p>Not all tests are created equal! <strong>Modifiers </strong>are adjustments made to a test’s target number (not the roll itself), that make the test easier or harder for a character to pass. <strong>Bonuses </strong>are modifiers that increase the target number and thus make success more likely, while <strong>Penalties </strong>are modifiers that decrease the target number and thus make success less likely. If a test would be subject to more than one modifier, simply add their values together to determine the net modifier for that test.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Difficulty </strong>of a test is a modifier applied based on how much more difficult or easy the test becomes due to circumstance.</p>\n<p>One of the most important jobs of the GM is to determine the difficulty of tests. The test difficulty table below provides guidelines for recommended modifiers given particular levels of difficulty.</p>\n<p>Once the difficulty has been decided, apply the modifier to the test’s target number and roll the test against the modified target number. GMs who desire more finesse should not be afraid to assign test difficulty in increments of +/- 5.</p>\n<p><em>Example: A character attempts to break down a wooden door in a dungeon. The GM decides that this task would be relatively easy compared to breaking down a normal door, as the wood is aged and rotting, and so assigns a difficulty of Easy to this test. They also tell the player which Characteristic or Skill to use to determine the target number (more on this later). When making the test, the player would increase their normal target number by 20.</em></p>\n<table style=\"width:36.2491%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:170px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Modifier</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Effortless</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">+40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Simple</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Easy</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">+20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Ordinary</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Average</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Challenging</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Difficult</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">-20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Hard</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">-30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:65.7397%;height:17px\">Very Hard</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.6872%;height:17px;text-align:center\">-40</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that the GM should feel free to impose modifiers on tests beyond +/- 40 if it would be appropriate for the situation.
