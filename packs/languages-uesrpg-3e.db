Their attempt was largely successful, and most less common or more formal terms were replaced with newly coined Nedic, Nordic, or even entirely novel words. Day-to-day terminology, however, was firmly entrenched in the minds of Cyrodiils, and remains staunchly Ayleidoon in origin to this day. In rebuke of the Selectives&rsquo; efforts, Aldmeris found its way back into Cyrodilic in the years after the Middle Dawn; the merish tongue&rsquo;s dominance of Tamrielic scholarship has led to a plethora of high-prestige loanwords in all the dialects of Cyrodiil.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.6667px;\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/gep2t2/languages_of_tamriel_part_1_cyrodiil/\">Languages of Tamriel</a>, Maura Charboche - University of Gwylim Press, 4E197</span></p>","readWrite":true,"speak":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"qwt9o1cuKYitvD9G":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.C8IM5oTXTtjumEvA"}}}
